# WHEN BOT

This bot does some stuff.

`!when` - Add yourself to the when list  
`!when remove` - Remove yourself from the when list  
`!when reset` - Reset the entire when list  
`!when status` - Print the current status of the when list  
`!when ping` - Ping all the current people in the when list
